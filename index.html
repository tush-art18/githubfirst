                <h1>Shaheed Bhagat Singh</h1>
                <p>Bhagat Singh was born on September 28th, 1907, in Lyallpur, British India (now in Pakistan). His family was Sikh, and his dad, Kishan Singh, and uncle Ajit Singh were part of India's fight for freedom. Even when Bhagat was born, they were in jail for protesting a law. He went to a village school at first, then to a bigger one in Lahore. In 1923, he joined National College in Lahore, started by Lala Lajpat Rai, who was fighting for India's independence. This college followed Gandhi's idea of not supporting British-run schools. His family was into politics, so Bhagat got into India's freedom fight too. He went to Jallianwala Bagh right after the massacre there, where thousands were killed by General Dyer.</p>

            </blockquote></h2>
            <p>Bhagat Singh admired revolutionary leaders like Karl Marx, Lenin, and his hero Kartar Singh Sarabha. <br>
                He strongly believed in socialism, thinking it was the way to change society for the better. <br>
                Bhagat Singh did not just want political freedom for India; he also wanted economic freedom. <br>
                He thought socialism was the solution to India's problems. <br>
                His ideas were new and different, but a lot of people liked what he said.

            <h2>Revolutionary Acts</h2>
             <p id="para1">In 1928 Indian writer and politician Lajpat Rai was brutally assaulted by James A. Scott, the superintendent of police, while leading a silent march opposing the Simon Commission—a 1927 British-appointed body tasked with reviewing the working of the Indian constitution established by the Government of India Act of 1919. Though Rai survived the attack, he succumbed to his injuries shortly thereafter. Singh, along with his associates Sukh Dev Thapar and Shivram Rajguru, plotted to kill Scott to avenge Rai’s death. Instead, in a case of mistaken identity, the assistant superintendent of police, J.P. Saunders, was killed, and Singh fled to Lahore to escape the death penalty. In 1929 Singh and an associate lobbed several bombs at the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi to protest the implementation of the Defence of India Act and then surrendered.</p>
            <p>As a result of Saunders’s assassination, Singh, Rajguru, Thapar, and 12 others were sent for trial under the Lahore Conspiracy Case (1930). While in jail during the trial, Singh helped organize a hunger strike to protest the ill treatment of prisoners, a demonstration that gained him wide support in India. The court ruled that Singh, Rajguru, and Thapar would be hanged for the murder of Saunders. They were executed and cremated in Lahore on March 23, 1931. This day is now observed as Martyrs’ Day in India to honor the sacrifice of Bhagat Singh and his associates during the freedom struggle.</p>
